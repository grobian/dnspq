The objective of DNSpq is to query multiple DNS servers in parallel when
trying to resolve a query.  The pq in DNSpq hence stands for Parallel
Query.  Querying multiple servers in parallel is non-standard and
aggressive towards nameservers, so not suited for use other than for a
specific use-case, whis is most likely constrained to a local area
network and dedicated DNS servers.
